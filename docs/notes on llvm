=== Simplification: ===

Where you see "tail call", you can replace it with "call". It's just an optimization.
 - investigate assembly

Maybe: Where you see "attributes #\d = { ... }" you can replace it with "{ nounwind }".
 - investigate assembly
 - see if that's true in all cases

=== Notes: ===

LLVM doesn't store string literals as char*'s. They're constants somewhere in memory and then casted
 to char*'s when used.
